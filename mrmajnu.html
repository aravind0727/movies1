        <dd>Vikram Krishna, known as Vicky, is a charming young man who flirts with everyone but has never had a serious relationship. Nikitha, or Nikki, is a young woman who dreams of marrying someone like Lord Ram. One day, Nikki hears about Vicky being caught by the university dean while romancing his daughter, and she is disgusted, calling Vicky a "dangerous character." Despite this, Nikki is forced to go shopping with Vicky since her brother is marrying Vicky’s sister. Reluctantly, Nikki agrees, but she gradually discovers Vicky’s kind side and falls in love with him.</dd>
        <dd>Nikki confesses her feelings to Vicky and asks him to be in a two-month relationship, keeping it secret from their families. Vicky hesitantly agrees, but soon finds himself uncomfortable with Nikki’s over-enthusiastic behavior as she tries to change his lifestyle. Nikki accidentally reveals their relationship to both families, who promptly arrange their marriage. Feeling burdened, Vicky confides in his best friend Chitti about his struggles. Overhearing this, Nikki believes she is a burden to Vicky and breaks up with him in front of everyone, thinking he is unhappy with her.</dd>
        <dd>Nikki leaves for London, and Vicky realizes he truly loves her. He follows her to London to prove his love, but discovers that Nikki has told everyone in her neighborhood about him, turning them against him. Vicky, introduced as Krishna by Pulla Rao, befriends her family and tries to win back Nikki, but she rejects all his efforts. Realizing she won't take him back, Vicky confesses the truth to Nikki's family and heads to the airport to return to India.</dd>
        <dd>Nikki's family makes her realize her mistake and Vicky's genuine love for her. She rushes to the airport to stop him, and in her haste, damages another car. When Nikki sees Vicky talking to a girl he had previously flirted with, she angrily slaps her, only to learn that the girl was inviting Vicky to her wedding. After clearing up the misunderstandings, Nikki and Vicky reunite and get married. Later, when Nikki faces charges for damaging the car, Vicky prepares to charm the female officer, hinting that he will always be a lover boy.</dd>
