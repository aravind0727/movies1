        <dd>Ajay Varma, a Hyderabad-based Kabaddi player and son of DGP Vijay Varma, travels to Kurnool for a state-level tournament. While there, Ajay saves Swapna Reddy from Obul Reddy, a ruthless faction leader who wants to marry Swapna against her will. Swapna plans to escape to the US to live with her uncle and pursue her studies after Obul killed her brothers, who disapproved of his interest in their sister due to the age gap.</dd>
        <dd>In the process of rescuing Swapna, Ajay humiliates Obul by pushing him into a mud pond. Furious, Obul vows not to cleanse the mud until Swapna is found and returned to him. Ajay brings Swapna to his home in Hyderabad's Old City, hiding her in his room with the help of his sister, Asha. However, Ajay's parents discover Swapna's presence in their house. Swapna escapes with Ajay, and during this time, they both fall in love.</dd>
        <dd>The next day, Vijay and his police team surround the Charminar, where Ajay is hiding Swapna. Ajay, Swapna, and his friends manage to reach the airport, where Swapna's parents come to see her one last time before she leaves. As Swapna passes through airport security, Ajay realizes his love for her. Swapna then returns to Ajay, proposes to him, and they embrace. However, at the airport, Vijay arrests Ajay, and Obul's men capture Swapna.</dd>
        <dd>Swapna taunts Obul, saying that Ajay will come for her. Obul confronts Ajay in prison, but Ajay, with the help of his friends, kidnaps Obul and his men. Later, Ajay participates in the finals of the national-level Kabaddi tournament. Meanwhile, Obul's brother, Home Minister Siva Reddy, is at the venue for Obul's marriage to Swapna. Learning of Obul's whereabouts, Siva, along with Swapna and their mother, heads to the stadium.</dd>
        <dd>Ajay and Obul engage in a fierce fight, where Ajay ultimately defeats Obul. Swapna's father then stabs Obul, and his mother dies in a bomb blast. Siva Reddy decides not to retaliate, fearing it would harm his political career. Ajay and his friends win the Kabaddi tournament and celebrate their victory with Swapna and his family.</dd>
