        <dd>1998: In Guntur, brothers Dokka Marx Babu and Lenin Babu, notorious hooligans, burn down Bhogineni Satyam's mirchi factory. Satyam confronts them while the factory is ablaze, leading to a fight where his brother-in-law, Rangam, accidentally kills Lenin. Satyam takes the blame and is sentenced to 12 years in jail. His son, Ramana, partially loses vision in his left eye during the explosion. Satyam's wife, Vasundhara, leaves with Ramana and moves in with her father, Vyra Venkata Swamy, a politician in Hyderabad. She later marries her paternal cousin, Pakka Rajagopal Narayana.</dd>
        <dd>2023: Vyra Venkata Swamy makes Vasundhara the Minister of Law but faces opposition from Kata Madhu, a member of their political party. Fearing exposure of Ramana as Vasundhara's son, Venkata Swamy attempts to make Ramana sign a document disowning any public connection with his mother in exchange for money. Ramana refuses, demanding to see his mother first. Venkata Swamy's lawyer, Basavaraju Sarangapaani "Paani", and his assistant Balu try to coerce Ramana into signing, but Ramana resists. Frustrated, Venkata Swamy registers a false FIR against Ramana, but Balu helps Ramana get bail. Ramana confronts Venkata Swamy and recreates the actions described in the FIR at his house.</dd>
        <dd>Vasundhara intervenes and slaps Ramana, forcing him to sign the document. Kata Madhu later reveals Ramana's identity to the media, escalating the conflict. Satyam tells Ramana that Vasundhara fought to save his eye after the factory incident, but Satyam prioritized saving Rangam. During Satyamâ€™s trial, Vasundhara, enraged by her son's condition, falsely testified against Satyam. Depressed by this revelation, Ramana is kidnapped by "Gelatin" Babji, a contract killer hired by Narayana under Venkata Swamy's orders.</dd>
        <dd>Vasundhara is injured in a lorry accident orchestrated by Venkata Swamy for political gain. Venkata Swamy convinces Ramana to kill the culprits, revealing his past manipulations, including the factory attack in 1998. Ramana learns that Vasundhara adopted Gopal, Narayana's supposed son, to protect Ramana. Venkata Swamy's schemes are exposed, but Vasundhara stops Ramana from retaliating, and they return to Guntur, reuniting with Satyam. In the end, Venkata Swamy's plans to bring Ramana into politics fail as Narayana mocks him.</dd>
