        <dt><b>Description:-</b></dt>
        <dd>In 3102 BC, after the Kurukshetra War, Ashwatthama tries to kill Uttarā's unborn child. For this act, Krishna, the 8th incarnation of Vishnu, curses him to roam the Earth as an immortal, witnessing the decay of society and morals during the Kali Yuga. His divine gem is taken from his forehead, and he can only redeem himself by protecting the mother of Kalki, Vishnu's 10th incarnation, at the end of Kali Yuga.</dd>
        <dd>In 2898 AD, 6,000 years after the Kurukshetra War, the world is in a post-apocalyptic state, and the desertified city of Kasi is the last known city. Supreme Yaskin, a totalitarian god-king, rules Kasi from the Complex, an enormous inverted-pyramid megastructure. His reign is upheld by Commander Manas, Counsellor Bani, and Raiders who defend against the prophesied arrival of Kalki.</dd>
        <dd>In this dystopia, fertile female refugees in Kasi are forcibly taken to the Complex for Project K, a grim experiment to create a life-extending serum for the 200-year-old Yaskin. The serum is derived from artificially inseminated foetuses, but none of the women have survived. Raia, a young girl disguised as a boy, narrowly avoids conscription with the help of rebels from the hidden city of Shambhala. She takes refuge in a cave and meets Ashwatthama, unknowingly carrying his divine gem, Shivamani, which she received from Shambhala rebels. Together, they embark on a mission to find Kalki's mother.</dd>
        <dd>Meanwhile, at the Complex, a Project K worker named SUM-80 hides her 150-day pregnancy but is discovered and captured. Manas extracts a drop of serum from her foetus before rebels from Shambhala rescue her. Renaming herself Sumathi, she and the rebels head to Shambhala, but are ambushed by bounty hunters and Raiders. Ashwatthama intervenes, sensing that Kalki is Sumathi’s unborn child. Despite Bhairava's efforts, Ashwatthama defeats him, and the group safely reaches Shambhala, where the tree of life blooms in Kalki's presence.</dd>
        <dd>Bhairava, a bounty hunter, strikes a deal with Manas to capture Sumathi in exchange for entry into the Complex. He infiltrates Shambhala by posing as Ashwatthama and convinces Sumathi to flee with him but is intercepted by the real Ashwatthama. A battle ensues, and Shambhala's leader, Mariam, tries to save Sumathi but is killed by Manas. Bhairava’s walking stick is revealed to be Karna’s bow, Vijaya Dhanush, transforming him into a superhuman warrior. He defeats the Raiders, kills Manas, and takes Sumathi away.

            At the Complex, Yaskin uses the serum drop to partially gain Kalki’s powers. He picks up Arjuna's bow, Gandiva, and vows to capture Sumathi and her child to reshape the world.</dd>
